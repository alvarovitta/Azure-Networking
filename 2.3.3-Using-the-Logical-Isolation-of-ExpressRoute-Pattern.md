# Using the Logical Isolation of ExpressRoute Pattern
Use the procedure described in this section to create and deploy an ExpressRoute for each line of business. 
<br />
<br />

**When to use**  
Use pattern when you want to ensure service availability and dedicated bandwidth to different LOBs. 
<br />
<br />

The following diagram illustrates a logical isolation of ExpressRoute pattern. Multiple ExpressRoute circuits connect the on-premises network to the lines of business (LOB 1, LOB 2 and LOB 3) VNets. Each VNet in a LOB connects to a single ExpressRoute circuit.

|Advantages	| Disadvantages |
| -------------- | ------------- |
|Full isolation from other services or workloads in Azure for each ExpressRoute circuit	| More complex to manage since Shared Services will have to manage multiple ExpressRoute circuits |
|Each department/line of business have their own logical ExpressRoute connection | Additional transit IP addresses and VLANs required|
|Flexible administration of ExpressRoute circuits. Departments or Shared Services can own and administer ExpressRoutes | Security services in Azure need to be implemented on all subscriptions and virtual networks and must be scaled accordingly|
|Azure IP addresses are only advertised in the VLAN's associated with the specific ExpressRoute circuit	||
|Easier to allocate costs to lines of businesses/applications/projects ||
|Easier to manage since its 1 virtual network per region for each line of business ||
|Unlikely to hit scaling limits for subscriptions or virtual network  mappings on each ExpressRoute circuit ||
|Easier to move individual ExpressRoute circuits/workloads to other exchange ports/switches for availability purposes. This helps to avoid a single point of failure on peering routers	|

## Guidance
Use the following supplemental information:
- Ensure that you have a stringent, "Least privileged access" RBAC model on your shared services VNET per LOB
	
- Place your first layer of security defense (NVAs, WAFs)  on the shared services VNET (Hub)  per LOB	
- Place all your transit resources (VPN, VNET gateways) in the LOB Hub VNET	
- Avoid creating daisy chain VNETS (multi hub and spoke sub hierarchies). Microsoft does not support transit routing.
<br />
<br />	

## Preparation
Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks: 
- Review the [prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-prerequisites) and [workflows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-workflows) before you begin configuration.
	
- Ensure that you have the correct permissions to Azure before starting the implementation (I.e. Subscription Owner)

## Procedure:  How to create and modify an ExpressRoute VPN
Follow the steps below to create, provision, modify or delete an ExpressRoute circuit:
	
1. [Create and provision the ExpressRoute circuit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager#create)  
  Create an Azure ExpressRoute circuit by using the Azure portal and the Azure Resource Manager deployment model. 
	
2. [Get the status of the ExpressRoute circuit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager#status)  
  View the status of an ExpressRoute circuit by selecting it and viewing the Overview page. 
	
3. [Modify an ExpressRoute circuit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager#modify)  
  Modify certain properties of an ExpressRoute circuit without impacting connectivity.
	
4. [Deprovision and delete an ExpressRoute circuit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager#delete)  
  Click on the Delete icon to delete your ExpressRoute circuit.
