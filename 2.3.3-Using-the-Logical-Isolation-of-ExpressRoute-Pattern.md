# Using the Logical Isolation of ExpressRoute Pattern


Use the procedure described in this section to create and deploy an ExpressRoute for each line of business. 


When to use
Use pattern when you want to ensure service availability and dedicated bandwidth to different LOBs. 

The following diagram illustrates a logical isolation of ExpressRoute pattern. Multiple ExpressRoute circuits connect the on-premises network to the lines of business (LOB 1, LOB 2 and LOB 3) VNets. Each VNet in a LOB connects to a single ExpressRoute circuit.

Table:

Advantages	Disadvantages
Full isolation from other services or workloads in Azure for each ExpressRoute circuit	More complex to manage since Shared Services will have to manage multiple ExpressRoute circuits
Each department/line of business have their own logical ExpressRoute connection	Additional transit IP addresses and VLANs required
Flexible administration of ExpressRoute circuits. Departments or Shared Services can own and administer ExpressRoutes.	Security services in Azure need to be implemented on all subscriptions and virtual networks and must be scaled accordingly.
Azure IP addresses are only advertised in the VLAN's associated with the specific ExpressRoute circuit	
Easier to allocate costs to lines of businesses/applications/projects	
Easier to manage since its 1 virtual network per region for each line of business	
Unlikely to hit scaling limits for subscriptions or virtual network  mappings on each ExpressRoute circuit.	
Easier to move individual ExpressRoute circuits/workloads to other exchange ports/switches for availability purposes. This helps to avoid a single point of failure on peering routers.	



Guidance
Use the following supplemental information:

	• Ensure that you have a stringent, "Least privileged access" RBAC model on your shared services VNET per LOB
	
	• Place your first layer of security defense (NVAs, WAFs)  on the shared services VNET (Hub)  per LOB
	
	• Place all your transit resources (VPN, VNET gateways) in the LOB Hub VNET
	
	• Avoid creating daisy chain VNETS (multi hub and spoke sub hierarchies). Microsoft does not support transit routing.
	


Preparation
Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks: 

	• Review the prerequisites and workflows before you begin configuration.
	
	• Ensure that you have the correct permissions to Azure before starting the implementation (I.e. Subscription Owner)



Procedure:  How to create and modify an ExpressRoute VPN
Follow the steps below to create, provision, modify or delete an ExpressRoute circuit:
	
	1. Create and provision the ExpressRoute circuit
	Create an Azure ExpressRoute circuit by using the Azure portal and the Azure Resource Manager deployment model. 
	
	2. Get the status of the ExpressRoute circuit
	View the status of a circuit by selecting it and viewing the Overview page. 
	
	3. Modify an ExpressRoute circuit
	Modify certain properties of an ExpressRoute circuit without impacting connectivity.
	
	4. Deprovision and delete an ExpressRoute circuit
	Delete your ExpressRoute circuit by selecting the Delete icon.
