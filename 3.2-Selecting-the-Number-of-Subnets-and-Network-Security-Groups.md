# Selecting the Number of Subnets and Network Security Groups
Use the procedure described in this section to determine the number of subnets and network security groups you will require for your Azure network environment.
<br />
<br />

## Guidance
- Use subnets to separate groups of VMs from one another for workloads that have a multi-layer structure. Apply different network security groups (NSGs) for those subnets.
	
- Use VPN gateways and ExpressRoute circuits to connect your VNets to one another and to your on-premises data center(s). VPN gateways and ExpressRoute circuits require a subnet of their own to be created.
	
- Use a network virtual appliance, such as a firewall, WAN accelerator, in an Azure VNet. You will need to route traffic to those appliances and isolate them in their own subnet.
	
- If your subnet address space does not contain a sufficient number of IP addresses for the number of NICs in the subnet, create multiple subnets. 
	
- If you require workloads or specific cloud services to be completely isolated from each other, create separate subnets that use separate IP address spaces. 
	
- Azure reserves five private IP addresses from each subnet.  
  The following IP addresses cannot be used:  
  - the first and last addresses of the address space (for the subnet address, and multicast) 
  - 3 addresses to be used internally (for DHCP and DNS purposes).
<br />
<br />

## Preparation
Before performing the procedure, consider the following when determining the number of subnets and NSGs required.

- Identify your requirements for the workloads or cloud services you wish to move to Azure. Use this information to determine the number of subnets and NSG's you require for your virtual networks. For example, identify which subnets you require for each tier (e.g.  web, application and data tiers). 
	 
- For Azure gateway subnets, determine an address space with at least a 29-bit prefix length  (example: 192.168.15.248/29). A 28-bit or smaller prefix length is recommended, especially if you are planning to use ExpressRoute.

- Determine how you want to filter traffic for your workloads or applications. For example,  determine the type of rules you wish to implement for inbound/outbound traffic between the subnets. 
	
- Define the rules you wish to apply to your network security groups. Rules are processed in ascending priority order. Priority numbers in network security groups range from 100 to 4096. Lower numbers are processed before higher numbers, because lower numbers have a higher priority. 
	
- You cannot remove the default rules, but you can override them by creating rules with higher priority.
