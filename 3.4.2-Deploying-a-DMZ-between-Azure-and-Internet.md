# Deploying a DMZ between Azure and Internet


Use the procedure described in this section to deploy a secure hybrid network that extends  between Azure and the Internet.

**When to use**
	
  - Hybrid applications where workloads run partly on-premises and partly in Azure.
  - Azure infrastructure that routes incoming traffic from on-premises and the Internet.


The figure below illustrates an architecture that implements a DMZ between Azure and your on-premises data center. In addition to the private DMZ that handles traffic from the on-premises network, the architecture also has a public DMZ that handles Internet traffic.

|**Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |  
| -------------| -------------| 
|Adds a public DMZ that handles internet traffic in addition to the private DMZ that handles traffic from the on-premises network | Adds a layer of complexity in terms of configuration and management as it requires multiple Azure resources such as NVA, load balancer, etc.|
|Provides granular control over traffic entering an Azure VNET from an on-premises network | Traffic can go out through Azure internet without being audited through the on-premises network|
| Helps to comply with regulatory requirements of many commercial systems and can help prevent public disclosure of private information | |
| Can provide dynamic routing between your network and Microsoft over industry standard protocols (BGP). | |



## Guidance 
In addition to the guidance from [Deploying a DMZ between Azure and On-Premises](3.4.1-Deploying-a-DMZ-between-Azure-and-On-Premises.md), follow these recommendations:

  - [Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/dmz/secure-vnet-dmz#nva-recommendations):  Use one set of NVAs for traffic originating on the Internet, and another for traffic originating on-premises.
	
  - [Public Load Balancer recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/dmz/secure-vnet-dmz#public-load-balancer-recommendations):  For scalability and availability, deploy the public DMZ NVAs in an [availability set](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/manage-availability) and use an [Internet facing load balancer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview#publicloadbalancer) to distribute Internet requests across the NVAs in the availability set.


## Preparation

  - Ensure you have the correct permissions to Azure before starting the implementation (I.e. Subscription Owner)
  - Review the prerequisites for [ExpressRoute and VPN prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-prerequisites). 
  - Review the link to help you [Validate the Types of VPN devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices#devicetable) that are compatible with Azure  
  - Before configuring your VPN device, check for any [Known device compatibility issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices#known) for the VPN device that you want to use.  
  - Determine which VPN type you want to implement, see: [Path-Based or Route-Based](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-plan-design#vpntype).   
  - Determine the type of [Gateway SKU](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-plan-design#gwsku) you wish to implement.  
  - Consider configuring [forced tunnel routing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-forced-tunneling-rm#configure-forced-tunneling) if your security requirements require you to inspect and audit all internet traffic to and from your Azure network.  
  - Follow the guide on [How to Create a High Available Cross-Premise Connection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-highlyavailable). 



## Procedure: How to deploy a DMZ between Azure and On-Premises

Use the following guide as an example on how to deploy this solution.

[How to Deploy DMZ between Azure and Internet]((https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/dmz/secure-vnet-dmz#solution-deployment)): A deployment for a reference architecture that implements these recommendations is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mspnp/reference-architectures/tree/master/dmz/secure-vnet-dmz).
