# Deploying a DMZ between Azure and Internet


Use the procedure described in this section to deploy a secure hybrid network that extends  between Azure and the Internet.

When to use
	• Hybrid applications where workloads run partly on-premises and partly in Azure.
	• Azure infrastructure that routes incoming traffic from on-premises and the Internet.
The figure below illustrates an architecture that implements a DMZ between Azure and your on-premises data center. In addition to the private DMZ that handles traffic from the on-premises network, the architecture also has a public DMZ that handles Internet traffic.

Advantages	Disadvantages
Adds a public DMZ that handles internet traffic in addition to the private DMZ that handles traffic from the on-premises network 	Adds a layer of complexity in terms of configuration and management as it requires multiple Azure resources such as NVA, load balancer, etc. 

Provides granular control over traffic entering an Azure VNET from an on-premises network	Traffic can go out through Azure internet without being audited through the on-premises network
Helps to comply with regulatory requirements of many commercial systems and can help prevent public disclosure of private information	
Can provide dynamic routing between your network and Microsoft over industry standard protocols (BGP).	


Guidance 
In addition to the guidance from Using DMZ between Azure and On-Premises, follow these recommendations:

	• Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) recommendations:  Use one set of NVAs for traffic originating on the Internet, and another for traffic originating on-premises.
	
	• Public Load Balancer recommendations:  For scalability and availability, deploy the public DMZ NVAs in an availability set and use an Internet facing load balancer to distribute Internet requests across the NVAs in the availability set.


Preparation
	• Ensure that you have the correct permissions to Azure before starting the implementation (I.e. Subscription Owner)
	
	• Review the prerequisites for ExpressRoute and VPN prerequisites below 
	
	• Before you begin, review following guide to help you Validate the Types of VPN devices that are compatible with Azure
	  
	• Before configuring your VPN device, check for any Known device compatibility issues for the VPN device that you want to use.  
	
	• Review and determine which VPN type you want to implement: Path-Based or Route-Based.   
	
	• Review and determine the type of Gateway SKU you wish to implement. 
	 
	• Consider configuring forced tunnel routing if your security requirements require you to inspect and audit all internet traffic to and from your Azure network.  
	
	• Follow the guide on How to Create a High Available Cross-Premise Connection 



Procedure
Use the following guide as an example on how to deploy this solution.
