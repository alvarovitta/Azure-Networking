# Using the Mesh Network VNet Pattern
Use the information in this section to plan a Mesh Network VNet pattern.
<br />
<br />

A mesh network topology is a network structure in which virtual networks are connected with many redundant interconnections between network nodes. Every node has a connection to every other node in the network. 
<br />
<br />

**When to use**  
Use this pattern when you wish to isolate network connectivity to a set a virtual networks.

There are two types of mesh topologies: 
1. Full Mesh:  All the virtual networks are connected to each other
2. Partial Mesh:  At least two virtual networks have connections to multiple virtual networks 
<br />
<br />

|**Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |  
| -------------| -------------| 
|Handles high amounts of traffic because multiple devices can transmit data simultaneously. | Requires many connections, making it costlier to operate and manage than other topologies |
|A failure of one virtual network does not cause a break in the network or transmission of data. |The number of peering links required can quickly reach Azure limits |
| Adding additional virtual networks does not disrupt data traffic flow | Building and maintaining the topology can become complex and time consuming |
| |The chance of redundant connections is high, resulting in increased costs and potential for reduced efficiency. |

## Guidance
Use the following supplemental information:
- Plan your IP address CIDR blocks so that the IP addresses (I.e. subnets)  do not overlap with each other, or overlap with any of the ranges for other connections to which the gateways may connect.

- Determine the type of mesh network topology you wish to implement: Full-Mesh or Partial-Mesh
- Determine the number of virtual networks you will need for that topology
- Determine which virtual network will require VPN gateways if you are considering a partial-mesh network topology
