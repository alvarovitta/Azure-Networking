# Using a Point-to-Site VPN Pattern

Use either of the procedures described in this section to create and deploy a Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN. 
<br />
<br />

A P2S VPN gateway connection provides a secure connection between a virtual network and an individual client device. 

**When to use**
- telecommuters connect to Azure VNets from a remote location, such as from home or during a conference
- only a few clients need to connect to a VNet in Azure

A P2S connection originates at the client computer (Windows or MAC OS). P2S creates the VPN connection over either SSTP (Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol) or IKEv2 and does not require a VPN device or a public facing IP address.
<br />
<br />

The figure below illustrates the connectivity pathways between a PS2 VPN and client devices. The user has to be authenticated before Azure accepts a P2S VPN connection. 

Azure uses two methods to authenticate a connecting user:

1. [Authenticate using native Azure certificate authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/point-to-site-about#authenticate-using-native-azure-certificate-authentication):  A client certificate that is present on the device is used to authenticate the connecting user.
	
2. [Authenticate using Active Directory (AD) Domain Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/point-to-site-about#authenticate-using-active-directory-ad-domain-server):  AD Domain authentication allows users to connect to Azure using their organization domain credentials.

|header|:Advantages:|:Disadvantages:|
|Useful for telecommuters who want to connect to Azure VNets from a remote location, such as from home or a conference.| For Windows clients, you need administrator rights on the client device to create a VPN connection from the client device to Azure. Some organizations may have security policies that restrict users privileges.
Use in place of S2S VPN when you have only a few clients that need to connect to a VNet. 	Throughput speeds are not a guaranteed due to internet traffic conditions and your application behavior.
	The basic VPN SKU does not support IKEv2 or RADIUS authentication.
	Auto-reconnect and DDNS are currently not supported in P2S VPNs.
	P2S clients cannot connect to multiple virtual networks at the same time. A P2S client can only connect to resources in the VNet in which the virtual network gateway resides.


Guidance
Use the following supplemental information:

	• The Basic SKU does not support IKEv2 or RADIUS authentication. Use one of the following SKUs: VpnGw1, VpnGw2, VpnGw3. 
	
	• Windows clients must have administrator rights on the client device to initiate the VPN connection from the client device to Azure.



Preparation
Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks: 
	
	• Determine the configuration requirements for client devices:  Users use the native VPN clients on Windows and Mac devices for P2S. Azure provides a VPN client configuration zip file that contains settings required by these native clients to connect to Azure.
	
	• Determine which Gateway SKU you wish to use:  When you create a virtual network gateway, specify the gateway SKU that satisfies your requirements based on the types of workloads, throughputs, features, and SLAs (see Guidance above).


Procedure:  How to configure a P2S VPN using native authentication
Use the following when configuring a P2S VPN using the native authentication method.

	• A Route-Based VPN gateway.
	
	• The public key (.cer file) for a root certificate, which is uploaded to Azure. Once the certificate is uploaded, it is considered as a trusted certificate and is used for authentication.
	
	• A client certificate that is generated from the root certificate. The client certificate is installed on each client computer that will connect to the VNet. This certificate is used for client authentication.
	
	• A VPN client configuration. The VPN client configuration files contain the necessary information for the client to connect to the VNet. The files configure the existing VPN client that is native to the operating system. Each client that connects must be configured using the settings in the configuration files.


Perform the steps noted in the links below to configure P2S native authentication:

	1. Configure a Point-to-Site connection to a VNet using native Azure certificate authentication - Azure portal.
	
	2. Configure a Point-to-Site connection to a VNet using native Azure certificate authentication - PowerShell.



Procedure:  How to configure a P2S VPN using RADIUS authentication
Use the following when configuring a P2S VPN using the RADIUS authentication method.

	• A Route Based VPN gateway.
	
	• A RADIUS server to handle user authentication. The RADIUS server can be deployed on-premises, or in the Azure VNet.
	
	• A VPN client configuration package for the Windows devices that will connect to the VNet. A VPN client configuration package provides the settings required for a VPN client to connect over P2S.

Perform the following steps to configure P2S RADIUS authentication:
	1. Set up the Azure VPN gateway for P2S connectivity
	Create a VNet with a P2S connection that uses RADIUS authentication.
	
	2. Set up your RADIUS server for authentication
	Configure your RADIUS server for authentication before creating and configuring the virtual network gateway.
	
	3. Create a VPN Client Configuration for RADIUS authentication
	Configure the client device used to connect to a virtual network over P2S. 
	
	4. Complete your P2S configuration and connect
	Create a VNet with a P2S connection that uses RADIUS authentication.
