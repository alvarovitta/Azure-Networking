# Using the Shared ExpressRoute Pattern

Use the procedure described in this section to create and deploy a shared ExpressRoute VPN pattern.


**When to use**
This pattern is useful when you want to connect all your VNets to a single express circuit.

The following diagram illustrates a single Shared ExpressRoute Pattern. A single ExpressRoute circuit connects the on-premises network and all VNets. All lines of business (LOB 1, LOB 2, LOB 3) are linked directly with the ExpressRoute circuit.

<Insert figure here>

Table:

Advantages	Disadvantages
Flat architecture for some departments	Shared 10 GB ports. Possible for some LOBs to excessively consume more services at the expense of others
Simple to manage as there is only one express route circuit between the on-premises network and the Azure network	Capacity management issues. There is a lack of control over how much bandwidth is consumed by any one user.
Fewer transit IP addresses are required which means there are fewer BGP peerings	Single point of failure for all services in Azure. If the ExpressRoute circuit fails, all connections to services connected to and from on-premises network will be down
	There are scaling limits for the virtual networks and subscription mappings to ExpressRoute
	Allocation of ExpressRoute service keys costs to projects and departments are more complex
	Security services need to be scaled and designed to support traffic flow based on a single ExpressRoute design


Guidance
Use the following supplemental information:

	• Ensure that you have a stringent "Least privileged access" RBAC model on your shared services VNET 

	• Ensure there is no overlap on IP addresses used in each virtual network



Preparation
Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks: 

	• Review the prerequisites and workflows before you begin configuration.
	
	• Ensure that you have the correct permissions to Azure before starting the implementation (i.e. Subscription Owner).
