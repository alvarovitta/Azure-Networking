# Planning and Designing Native Azure Networking Patterns
Use the information in this section to leverage the networking patterns that are native to Azure and/or implement cross-premises networking patterns.
<br />
<br />

## Preparation
Use the following questions to assist with your decision-making process when planning your design:Â 
- What Azure locations will you use to host VNets?
	
- Do you need to provide communication between these Azure locations?
- Do you need to provide communication between your Azure VNet(s) and your on-premises data center(s)?
- How many Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) VMs, cloud services roles, and web apps do you need for your solution?
- Do you need to isolate traffic based on groups of VMs (i.e. front end web servers and back end database servers)?
- Do you need to control traffic flow using virtual appliances?
- Do users need different sets of permissions to different Azure resources?
<br />
<br />

## Next steps
Refer to the following sections in the sequence shown, when planning and designing the native Azure network patterns:

1. [Selecting the Number of Subscriptions and VNets](3.1-Selecting-the-Number-of-Subscriptions-and-VNets.md):  
  Use the information in this section to plan the number of subscriptions and VNets which best fits your needs.

2. [Selecting the Number of Subnets and Network Security Groups](3.2-Selecting-the-Number-of-Subnets-and-Network-Security-Groups.md):  
  Use the information in this section to plan the number of subnets and network security groups which best fits your needs.
3. [Selecting a Native Azure VNet Pattern](3.3-Selecting-a-Native-Azure-VNet-Pattern.md):  
  Use the information in this section to help you determine your Azure VNet requirements and identify the pattern which best fits your needs.  
4. [Selecting an Azure Network DMZ Pattern](3.4-Selecting-an-Azure-Network-DMZ-Pattern.md):  
  Use these patterns to help you secure and protect publicly exposed IT systems. 
5. [Selecting the Cross Tenant VNet Connection Pattern](3.5-Selecting-the-Cross-Tenant-VNet-Connection-Pattern.md):  
  Use this pattern to help you securely connect to other virtual networks that exist in different Azure AD tenants.
