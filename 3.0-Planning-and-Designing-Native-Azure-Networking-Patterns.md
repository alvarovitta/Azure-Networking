# Planning and Designing Native Azure Networking Patterns

Use the information in this section to leverage the networking patterns that are native to Azure and/or implement cross-premises networking patterns.



Preparation
Use the following questions to assist with your decision-making process when planning your design: 

	• What Azure locations will you use to host VNets?
	
	• Do you need to provide communication between these Azure locations?
	
	• Do you need to provide communication between your Azure VNet(s) and your on-premises data center(s)?
	
	• How many Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) VMs, cloud services roles, and web apps do you need for your solution?
	
	• Do you need to isolate traffic based on groups of VMs (i.e. front end web servers and back end database servers)?
	
	• Do you need to control traffic flow using virtual appliances?
	
	• Do users need different sets of permissions to different Azure resources?



Next steps
Refer to the following sections in sequence when planning and designing the native Azure network patterns:

	1. Selecting the Number of Subscriptions and VNets:  Use the information in this section to plan the number of subscriptions and VNets which best fits your needs.
	2. Selecting the Number of Subnets and Network Security Groups:  Use the information in this section to plan the number of subnets and network security groups which best fits your needs
	3. Selecting a Native Azure VNet Pattern:  Use the information in this section to help you determine your Azure VNet requirements and identify the pattern which best fits your needs.  

	4. Selecting an Azure Network DMZ Pattern:  Use these patterns to help you secure and protect publicly exposed IT systems. 

	5. Selecting the Cross Tenant VNet Connection Pattern:  Use this pattern to help you securely connect to other virtual networks that exist in different Azure AD tenants.
