# Selecting the Cross Tenant VNet Connection Pattern


Use the procedure in this section to deploy a Cross-Tenant VNet connection pattern.

**When to use**

  - When connecting virtual networks across different tenants
  
  - When you have to connect to VNets that exist in two different Azure ADs


The figure below illustrates a Cross Tenant VNet connection pattern that uses the Azure VPN gateways to securely connect two virtual networks using IPsec/IKE S2S VPN tunnels. The tunnels exist in different Azure AD tenants. Together with the Multi-Site VPNs, you can connect your virtual networks together in a topology that suits your business needs.

|**Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |  
| -------------| -------------| 
| Cross Tenant VNet connectivity provides connectivity between two different Azure AD tenants regardless of geo-presence | Can only be done using PowerShell|
| Provides cross organization communication in Azure ||
| Utilizes Microsoft backbone for this connectivity ||



## Guidance

Use the following supplemental information:

 - Verify the IP address ranges for the VNets do not overlap with each other, or overlap with any of the ranges for other connections to which the gateways are connected.
	
 - When working with gateway subnets, avoid associating a network security group (NSG) to the gateway subnet. Associating a network security group to this subnet may cause your VPN gateway to stop working as expected. 
	
 - Use Site-to-Site VPN as the cross tenant VNet pattern



## Preparation
	
  - Create or use the Azure Dynamic Routing VPN gateways to connect your virtual networks. Static Routing VPN gateways are NOT supported for VNet-to-VNet.
	
  - Ensure that the address prefixes donâ€™t overlap among all the connected networks.
	
  - Site-To-Site feature works for cross AD  connectivity (for example: same or different regions).



## Procedure:  How to deploy a cross tenant VNet connection Pattern

Connect your tenants by using the Site to Site (IPSec) process outlined. See:  [Configure a VNet-to-VNet VPN gateway connection using PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-vnet-vnet-rm-ps).
