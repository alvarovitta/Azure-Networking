# Governing your Network Resources in Azure

Use the information described in this section when consider how to govern your network resources in Azure.

Securing your network resources in Azure is critical to ensure that you have control over your data. Appropriate governance keeps your data secure and private while maintaining transparency and compliance.

Administrators leverage RBAC to assign specific duties within the organization. Administrators  grant users only the appropriate level of access needed. Assigning RBAC roles with sufficient privileges to accomplish the specified functions or tasks required will not only keep the data secure but also ensure that your network resources do not get inadvertently deleted. 
In terms of governance, while the network contributor role gives the network team enough access privileges to manage network resources in Azure but not enough to access them. 

Use the RBAC role so users can:
	
	• read roles and role assignments
	
	• create and manage alert rules
	
	• create and manage networks
	
	• Obtain the availability status for all resources in the specified scope
	
	• create and manage resource group deployments
	
	• obtain or list resource groups
	
	• create and manage support tickets



Guidance
Use the following supplemental information:

	• Use a least privileged model in RBAC for access control to virtual networks
	
	• Use the Network Contributor Role which allows manage networks, but not access to them.
	
	• Minimize the number of people you wish to be Network Contributors
	
	• Ensure you enable resource locks on the resource groups that hold network resources to prevent users from accidentally deleting them.
	
	• Implement resource locks on specific network resources such as your virtual network, application gateway, local network gateway, etc.
	
	• Monitor changes to your network resources by using real time alerts. Use Azure Monitor to set up your agents.
	
	• Implement just in time administration as a governance model for your Azure network resource groups and network resources.
	
	• Implement Azure network policies that force end users to use to the standards enforced by your organization. 
	
	For example:  Enforce a network policy to ensure an NSG is created for every subnet within your virtual network. Alternatively, specify a set of SKUs permitted for use to create an Application Gateway or ExpressRoute circuit.
