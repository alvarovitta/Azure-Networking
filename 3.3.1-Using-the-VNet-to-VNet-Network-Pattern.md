# Using the VNet-to-VNet Network Pattern
Use the procedure described in this section to set up and configure a VNet-to-VNet network connection.
<br />
<br />

**When to use**  
Use this pattern to connect virtual networks to each other using a specific VNet-to-VNet connection type such as VNet Peering or Site-to-Site.
- To connect to virtual networks within the same subscription or a different subscription
	
- To connect to virtual networks within the same region or a different region
- To set up your own geo-replication or synchronization with secure connectivity without going over the internet
- So that you can set up highly available workloads with geo-redundancy across multiple Azure regions. For example, setting up SQL Always On with Availability Groups across multiple Azure regions
- For isolation and security requirements, you may want to create multi-tier applications with multiple virtual networks connected to one another within the same region
<br />
<br />

The following figure illustrates that the VNet-to-VNet connectivity uses the Azure VPN gateways to connect two or more virtual networks together. The secure, inter-network connections use IPsec/IKE S2S VPN tunnels.

|**Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |  
| -------------| -------------| 
| Creating a VNet-to-VNet connection is typically faster and easier than creating a site-to-site connection between VNets |Address ranges for the VNets cannot overlap with one another or overlap with any of the ranges for other connections to which the gateways may connect.|
| Set up your own geo-replication or synchronization with secure connectivity without going over Internet-facing endpoints  | You cannot use different VPN types when connecting VNets. The VPN type must be the same for both VNets to connect both VNets. |
| With Azure Traffic Manager and Load Balancer, you can set up highly available workload with geo-redundancy across multiple Azure regions.   | |
| Within the same region, you can set up multi-tier applications with multiple virtual networks connected together due to isolation or administrative requirements.   ||
| Virtual networks can be connected to other virtual networks in different regions and subscriptions   |  |

## Guidance
Use the following supplemental information:
- Verify that the IP address ranges for the VNets do not overlap with each other, or overlap with any of the ranges for other gateway connections.

- When working with gateway subnets, avoid associating a network security group (NSG) to the gateway subnet. Associating a network security group to this subnet may cause your VPN gateway to stop functioning as expected.

## Preparation
Review the [VNet-to-VNet Settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-vnet-vnet-resource-manager-portal#values). Determine how to configure the VPN settings prior to creating your virtual networks and the connection between them.
<br />
<br />

## Procedure:  How to configure and verify a VNet-to-VNet connection
Once you have reviewed the preparation steps, configure a VNet-to-VNet connection using one of the following methods (Azure, PowerShell, CLI):

**Using Azure**:
Perform the following steps if you choose to use the Azure portal.

1. [Configure a VNet-to-VNet Connection using Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-vnet-vnet-resource-manager-portal#CreatVNet)  
   Create a VNet in the Resource Manager deployment model by using the Azure portal.
	
2. [Verify the VNet Connections](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-vnet-vnet-resource-manager-portal#VerifyConnection)  
   Locate the virtual network gateway in the port and verify the Status values as: Succeeded and Connected. 
<br />

**Using PowerShell**:
Perform the following steps if you choose to use the PowerShell interface.

1. [How to Configure a VNet-to-VNet Connection for VNets in the Same Subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-vnet-vnet-rm-ps#samesub)  
   Create virtual networks along with their respective gateway subnets and configurations, then create a VPN connection between the        VNets.

2. [How to Configure a VNet-to-VNet Connection for VNets in Different Subscriptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-vnet-vnet-rm-ps#difsub)  
   Plan the IP address ranges, create and configure the VNet  ranges then verify the IP address.
	
3. [How to Verify Connections](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-vnet-vnet-rm-ps#verify)  
   Verify the status value as: Connected. 
<br />

**Using the CLI**:
Perform the following steps if you choose to use the command line interface.

1. [How to Configure a VNet-to-VNet Connection for VNets in the Same Subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-vnet-vnet-cli#samesub)  
   Create virtual networks along with their respective gateway subnets and configurations, then create a VPN connection between the VNets.
	
2. [How to Configure a VNet-to-VNet Connection for VNets in Different Subscriptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-vnet-vnet-cli#difsub)  
   Plan the IP address ranges, create and configure the VNet  ranges then verify the IP address.
	
3. [How to Verify Connections using CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-vnet-vnet-cli#verify)  
   Verify the status value as: Connected.
