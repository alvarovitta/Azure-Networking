# Using the Shared ExpressRoute with Hub & Spoke Pattern
Use the procedure described in this section to create and deploy a shared ExpressRoute with a Hub and Spoke VPN pattern.
<br />
<br />

**When to use**  
Use this design pattern when you want to implement a single entry/exit point to/from Azure for all your virtual networks and have those respective virtual networks peer one another.
<br />
<br />

The following diagram illustrates a Shared ExpressRoute with a hub and spoke pattern. An  ExpressRoute circuit connects the shared services network (VNet) with the on-premises network. All lines of business (LOBs 1-2, LOB 3-2) spokes can leverage the shared services VNet through VNet peering.

<br />

|Advantages	|Disadvantages |
|--------- | ----------- |
|You can aggregate connections so youâ€™re less likely to encounter the peering link limit |Hubs can become a potential single-point of failure. <br /><br /> E.g.: a single hub failure causes a break the chain and in turn, causes other VN failures.|
|Easy to add and remove spokes without affecting the rest of the network. Lines of businesses are given greater flexibility within their environments | When communication between virtual networks travels through two or more hubs, the custom route tables and network virtual appliances can cause higher latency. |
| Supports centralized management and monitoring | There are [limitations of virtual network peerings per virtual network](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits#networking-limits) in Azure. |
|| The cost of resources accumulates while the combination of traffic rules and peering links can make deployments challenging to deploy and manage. |

## Guidance
Use the following supplemental information:
- Ensure that you have a stringent "Least privileged access" RBAC model on your shared services VNET 
	
- Place your first layer of security defense (NVAs, WAFs) on the shared services VNET (Hub)
- Place all your transit resources (VPN, VNET gateways) in the Hub VNET
- Avoid creating daisy chain VNETS (multi hub and spoke sub hierarchies) . Microsoft does not support transit routing.
<br />
<br />

## Preparation
Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks: 
- Review the [prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-prerequisites) and [workflows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-workflows) before you begin configuration.
	
- Ensure that you have the correct permissions to Azure before starting the implementation (I.e. Subscription Owner)

## Procedure:  How to create and modify an ExpressRoute VPN
Follow the steps below to create, provision, modify or delete an ExpressRoute circuit:

1. [Create and provision the ExpressRoute circuit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager#create)  
  Create an Azure ExpressRoute circuit by using the Azure portal and the Azure Resource Manager deployment model. 
	
2. [Get the status of the ExpressRoute circuit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager#status)  
  View the status of an ExpressRoute circuit by selecting it and viewing the Overview page. 
	
3. [Modify an ExpressRoute circuit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager#modify)  
  Modify certain properties of an ExpressRoute circuit without impacting connectivity.
	
4. [Deprovision and delete an ExpressRoute circuit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager#delete)  
  Click on the Delete icon to delete your ExpressRoute circuit.
