# Using the Logical Isolation of ExpressRoute with Hub and Spoke Pattern
Use the procedure described in this section to create and deploy an ExpressRoute with Hub and  Spoke pattern dedicated for each line of business.
<br />
<br />

**When to use**  
Use this design pattern when you want to implement a dedicated express route circuit for each line of business. Each line of business has a shared services VNet and all virtual networks in that line of business peer with their own dedicated shared services VNet.
<br />
<br />

The following diagram illustrates a Logical ExpressRoute using a multiple hub and spoke pattern. The shared services virtual network hub connects to a line of business virtual network hub (LOB 1 and LOB 3). In turn, the LOB VNet connects to other lines of business virtual networks (I.e. LOB 1-2 and LOB 3-2) using VNet peering. The LOB VNet connections are known as spokes.

|Advantages	| Disadvantages |
| ------------ | ------------ |
|Hubs allow you to aggregate connections so you’re less likely to encounter the peering link limit | Hubs can become a potential single-point of failure. <br />For example, if one hub goes down for any reason, it will break the chain and cause other virtual networks to go down.|
|It’s easy to add and remove spokes without affecting the rest of the network. This ability gives LOBs greater flexibility within their environments	|When communication between virtual networks travels through two or more hubs, the custom route tables and network virtual appliances can cause higher latency.|
|Supports centralized management and monitoring	|There are [limitations of virtual network peerings per virtual network](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits#networking-limits) in Azure|
||	The cost of using these resources can accumulate. The combination of traffic rules and peering links can make deployments challenging to deploy and manage. |

## Guidance
Use the following supplemental information:
- Ensure that you have a stringent, "Least privileged access" RBAC model on your shared services VNETs 

- Place your first layer of security defense (NVAs, WAFs)  on the shared services VNETs (HUB)
- Place all your transit resources (VPN, VNET gateways) in the Hub VNETs
- Avoid creating daisy chain VNETs (multi hub and spoke sub hierarchies). Microsoft does not support transit routing.
<br />
<br />

## Preparation
Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks: 
- Review the [prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-prerequisites) and [workflows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-workflows) before you begin configuration.
	
- Ensure that you have the correct permissions to Azure before starting the implementation (I.e. Subscription Owner)

## Procedure:  How to create and modify an ExpressRoute VPN
Follow the steps below to create, provision, modify or delete an ExpressRoute circuit:
	
1. [Create and provision the ExpressRoute circuit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager#create)  
  Create an Azure ExpressRoute circuit by using the Azure portal and the Azure Resource Manager deployment model. 
	
2. [Get the status of the ExpressRoute circuit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager#status)  
  View the status of an ExpressRoute circuit by selecting it and viewing the Overview page. 
	
3. [Modify an ExpressRoute circuit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager#modify)  
  Modify certain properties of an ExpressRoute circuit without impacting connectivity.
	
4. [Deprovision and delete an ExpressRoute circuit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager#delete)  
  Click on the Delete icon to delete your ExpressRoute circuit.
