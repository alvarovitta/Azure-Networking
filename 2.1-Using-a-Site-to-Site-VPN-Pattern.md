# Using a Site to Site VPN Pattern

Use the procedure described in this section to create and deploy a Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN.


### When to use
- To connect an on-premises network to Azure 
	
- To connect multi-site on-premises networks to Azure
	
- To connect Azure virtual networks to other Azure virtual networks

The figure below illustrates a Site-to-Site VPN. The VPN connects any of your on-premises systems to any virtual machine or role instance within your Azure virtual network. This type of connectivity pattern consists of an Azure VPN gateway, an on-premises VPN device, and an IPsec Site-to-Site VPN tunnel connecting the two networks.

Table
Advantages	Disadvantages
All traffic is encrypted through the tunnel from your on-premises network to Azure.	Requires significant overhead and effort to set up  on-premises connectivity to your on-premises active directory.

Creates the foundational connectivity so you can extend your on-premises domain controllers to Azure.	Possible to have slow and unreliable connections depending on your on-premises internet connectivity. 

Use the same site-to-site VPN infrastructure to integrate other services.	Possible latency for applications that require authentication to on-premises backend systems.
Highly scalable. Easy to add multiple site-to-site connections to the Azure VPN gateway.	
All devices on the on-premises network communicate with Azure services connected to a VNet. There is no need to configure individual connections for each device.	

Guidance
Use the following supplemental information:

	• Configure a public-facing IPv4 IP address for your on-premise VPN device. Ensure the IPv4 IP address is not hidden behind a Network Address Translation (NAT).
	
	• Use a unique IP address range specifically for the virtual network being deployed on Azure. If the same address range is used on both sides of the VPN connection, traffic routing may be unpredictable.
		
	• Use a complex Shared Key. Configure your on-premises VPN device using the key. Use the same key to configure the Site-to-Site VPN connection on Azure.
		
	• Use Dynamic routing protocol (BGP) for routing control. BGP automatically adds multiple static routes.
	
	• Use redundant tunnels to prevent single point of failures (active-active) . 



Preparation 
Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks:

	• Review: Validated VPN devices and device configuration guides to validate the types of VPN devices that are compatible with Azure.
	
	• Before configuring your VPN device, refer to:  Known device compatibility issues for any VPN device that you want to use. 
	
	• Review and determine the VPN type you want to deploy: Path-Based or Route-Based. 
	
	• Review and determine the type of Gateway SKU you wish to implement.
	
	• Consider configuring forced tunnel routing if your security requirements require you to inspect and audit all internet traffic to and from your Azure network.
	
	• Follow the guide on How to Create a Highly Available Cross-Premise Connection.



Procedure: How to create a site-to-site VPN
Perform the steps in this procedure to create a site-to-site VPN. 

Note: Complete steps 1 - 3 using the Azure Portal or PowerShell or ARM Template

	1. Create and configure an Azure VPN gateway
	Follow the instructions as shown in:  Create the VPN gateway  (Azure Virtual Network Gateway).
	
	2. Create and configure an Azure local network gateway that represents your on-premises network and VPN device
	Follow the instruction as shown in:  Create the local network gateway. 
	
	3. Create and configure an Azure VPN connection between the Azure VPN gateway and the local network gateway
	Follow the instructions as shown in:  Create the VPN connection.
	 
	4. Configure the on-premises VPN device to establish the S2S VPN tunnel with the Azure VPN gateway
	Configure your on-premise VPN device. 
	Use the guidance listed below to download a configuration script for your VPN device. 

		○ Use the script as a starting point. Modify the correct values as needed and deploy it to your on-premises VPN device. 
		
		○ The corresponding values for the Azure VPN gateway, virtual network, on-premises network address prefixes, and VPN connection properties should already be filled-in. 
			
			§ Follow the instruction as shown in:  Configure the on-premises VPN device. 
			
			§ Follow the instructions on how to use VPM device configuration scripts: Download the configuration script from Azure portal to configure your on-premise VPN devices for Site-to-Site VPN connections to the Azure VPN Gateway.
