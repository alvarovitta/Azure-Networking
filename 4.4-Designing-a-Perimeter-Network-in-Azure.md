# Designing a Perimeter Network In Azure

Use the guidance and procedure described in this section to implement a security infrastructure for your Perimeter network in Azure.


The figure below illustrates the relationship between the organization and Azure networks and the perimeter subnet. The perimeter network is the front end of the network; directly interfacing communication from the Internet. The incoming packets should flow through the security appliances, such as the firewall, IDS, and IPS, before reaching the back-end servers.

## Guidance

Use the following supplemental information:

  - Use the smallest number of boundaries that satisfy the security requirements for a given situation. With more boundaries, operations and troubleshooting can be more difficult, as well as the management overhead involved with managing the multiple boundary policies over time. However, insufficient boundaries increase risk. Finding the balance is critical.
	
  - Follow the guidelines on virtual network requirements to implement a successful perimeter network, see: [Perimeter network requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/best-practices-network-security#perimeter-network-requirements). 
	
  - Workloads must not store business critical information.
	
  - Access and updates to perimeter network configurations and deployments are limited to only authorized administrators.
	


## Preparation

Use the questions listed below to define a network with a perimeter subnet and multiple security boundaries.

  1. How many boundaries are needed?
     The first decision point is to decide how many security boundaries are needed in a given scenario:
       - A single boundary: One on the front-end perimeter network, between the virtual network and the Internet.
       - Two boundaries: One on the Internet side of the perimeter network, and another between the perimeter network subnet and the back-end subnets in the Azure virtual networks.
       - Three boundaries: One on the Internet side of the perimeter network, one between the perimeter network and back-end subnets, and one between the back-end subnets and the on-premises network.
       - N boundaries: A variable number. Depending on security requirements, there is no limit to the number of security boundaries that can be applied in a given network.
	
  2. Where are the boundaries located?
     Once the number of boundaries are decided, where to implement them is the next decision point. There are generally three choices:
	
        - Using an Internet-based intermediary service (for example, a cloud-based Web application firewall, which is not discussed in this document)
	- Using native features and/or network virtual appliances in Azure
	- Using physical devices on the on-premises network
	On purely Azure networks, the options are native Azure features (for example, Azure Load Balancers) or network virtual appliances from the rich partner ecosystem of Azure (for example, Check Point firewalls).
	
	3. How are the boundaries implemented?
	Each security boundary will likely have different capability requirements (for example, IDS and firewall rules on the Internet side of the perimeter network, but only ACLs between the perimeter network and back-end subnet). Deciding on which device (or how many devices) to use depends on the scenario and security requirements. 



Procedure:  How to build a perimeter network
Use the following examples to understand the types of perimeter networks you can build:

	•  Example 1 Build a perimeter network to help protect applications with NSGs
	•  Example 2 Build a perimeter network to help protect applications with a firewall and NSGs
	•  Example 3 Build a perimeter network to help protect networks with a firewall and UDR and NSG
	•  Example 4 Add a hybrid connection with a site-to-site, virtual appliance VPN
	•  Example 5 Add a hybrid connection with a site-to-site, Azure VPN gateway
	•  Example 6 Add a hybrid connection with ExpressRoute
