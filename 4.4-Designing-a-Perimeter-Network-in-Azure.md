# Designing a Perimeter Network In Azure
Use the guidance and procedure described in this section to implement a security infrastructure for your Perimeter network in Azure.
<br />
<br />

The figure below illustrates the relationship between the organization and Azure networks and the perimeter subnet. The perimeter network is the front end of the network; directly interfacing communication from the Internet. The incoming packets should flow through the security appliances, such as the firewall, IDS, and IPS, before reaching the back-end servers.

## Guidance
Use the following supplemental information:
- Use the smallest number of boundaries that satisfy the security requirements for a given situation. More boundaries means that managing the multiple boundary policies becomes more challenging over time. Insufficient boundaries however, increase risk. Finding the balance is critical. 
	
- Follow the guidelines on virtual network requirements to implement a successful perimeter network, see: [Perimeter network requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/best-practices-network-security#perimeter-network-requirements). 
- Workloads must not store business critical information.
- Access and updates to perimeter network configurations and deployments are limited to only authorized administrators.

## Preparation
Use the questions listed below to define a network with a perimeter subnet and multiple security boundaries.  
1. How many boundaries are needed?   
   The first decision point is to decide how many security boundaries are needed in a given scenario:   
   
    a. **A single boundary**: One on the front-end perimeter network, between the virtual network and the Internet.  
    
    b. **Two boundaries**: One on the Internet side of the perimeter network, and another between the perimeter network subnet and the back-end subnets in the Azure virtual networks.  
    
    c. **Three boundaries**: One on the Internet side of the perimeter network, one between the perimeter network and back-end subnets, and one between the back-end subnets and the on-premises network.  
    
    d. **N boundaries**: A variable number. Depending on security requirements, there is no limit to the number of security boundaries that can be applied in a given network.
	
2. Where are the boundaries located?  
   Once the number of boundaries are decided, determine the where to implement them.   
   There are generally three choices:  
   
   a. Using an Internet-based intermediary service (for example, a cloud-based Web application firewall, which is not discussed in this document)  
  
   b. Using native features and/or network virtual appliances in Azure  
  
   c. Using physical devices on the on-premises network

   On pure Azure networks, the options are native Azure features (for example, Azure Load Balancers) or network virtual appliances from the rich partner ecosystem of Azure (for example, Check Point firewalls).
	
3. How are the boundaries implemented?  
  Each security boundary will likely have different capability requirements (for example, IDS and firewall rules on the Internet side of the perimeter network, but only ACLs between the perimeter network and back-end subnet). Deciding on which device (or how many devices) to use depends on the scenario and security requirements.
