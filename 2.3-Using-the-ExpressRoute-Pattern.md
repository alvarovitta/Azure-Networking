# Using the ExpressRoute Pattern


Use the information described in this section to help guide you to select the type of ExpressRoute pattern that best fits your needs.
<br />
<br />

Use Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute to extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection facilitated by a connectivity provider. 

With ExpressRoute, you can establish connections to Microsoft cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure, Office 365, and Dynamics 365.
ExpressRoute connections do not traverse the public Internet and therefore connections are more reliable, faster, have lower latencies, and provide higher security. For information on how to connect your network to Microsoft using ExpressRoute, see [ExpressRoute connectivity models](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-connectivity-models).
<br />
<br />

**When to use**
- To extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection to leverage IaaS, SaaS and PaaS services.
	
- If you wish to leverage a higher bandwidth when accessing Microsoft Azure cloud services.
	
- If you wish to connect to Microsoft through multiple locations and regions using [peering locations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-locations).
<br />
<br />

The figure below illustrates that connectivity can be from an any-to-any (IP VPN) network, a point-to-point Ethernet network, or a virtual cross-connection through a connectivity provider at a co-located facility.

| Advantages        | Disadvantages           |
| ------------- |---------------|
|Provides Layer 3 connectivity between your on-premises network and the Microsoft Cloud through a connectivity provider. Connectivity can be from an any-to-any (IPVPN) network, a point-to-point Ethernet connection, or through a virtual cross-connection via an Ethernet exchange.|	Requires payment for the VPN connection  purchased from your network service provider. The connectionâ€™s bandwidth has to match that of ExpressRoute otherwise, speed will be limited.|
Provides connectivity to Microsoft cloud services across all regions in the geopolitical region|
|Allows global connectivity to Microsoft services across all regions with ExpressRoute premium add-on||Provides dynamic routing between your network and Microsoft over industry standard protocols (BGP)|
|Provides dynamic routing between your network and Microsoft over industry standard protocols (BGP) |
|Provides built-in redundancy in every peering location for higher reliability||
|Provides QoS support for Skype for Business|	
Provides higher security, reliability and speeds with lower and consistent latencies than typical connections over the internet	
Cost effective: Transfer of data using ExpressRoute connections can yield significant cost benefits

## Guidance
Ensure your service provider or exchange service provider can facilitate a high performance VPN connection to Azure. 

For example:
- For Canada East, service providers include: Bell Canada, Megaport, Cologix, Telus, Zayo
	
- For Canada Central, service providers include: AT&T NetBond, Bell Canada, CenturyLink Cloud Connect, Cologix, Console, Equinix, Megaport, Telus, Zayo
<br />
<br />


## Next steps
Consider the ExpressRoute VPN patterns as listed below:

- [Shared ExpressRoute Pattern](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Azure-Networking/blob/master/2.3.1-Using-the-Shared-ExpressRoute-Pattern.md):  Use the procedure described in this section to create and deploy a shared ExpressRoute VPN pattern.
	
- [Shared ExpressRoute with Hub & Spoke Pattern](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Azure-Networking/blob/master/2.3.2-Using-the-Shared-ExpressRoute-with-Hub-and-Spoke-Pattern.md):  Use the procedure described in this section to create and deploy a shared ExpressRoute with a Hub and Spoke VPN pattern.

- [Logical Isolation of ExpressRoute Pattern](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Azure-Networking/blob/master/2.3.3-Using-the-Logical-Isolation-of-ExpressRoute-Pattern.md):  Use the procedure described in this section to create and deploy an ExpressRoute pattern.

- [Logical Isolation of ExpressRoute with Hub and Spoke Pattern](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Azure-Networking/blob/master/2.3.4-Using-the-Logical-Isolation-of-ExpressRoute-with-Hub-and-Spoke-Pattern.md):  Use the procedure described in this section to create and deploy an ExpressRoute pattern.
