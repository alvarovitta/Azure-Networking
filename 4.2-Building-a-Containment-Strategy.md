Building a Containment Strategy


Use the information described in this section when considering your containment strategy.

The containment strategy should plan to contain the propagation of risk at all feasible levels. The strategy will prioritize operational effectiveness and protection of assets according to business impact.
The containment strategy employs:
	• security zones (and isolation between the security zones)
	
	• containment within a security zone, within a host (i.e. between users and administrators) and within an application (as applicable)



Guidance
Use the following implementation strategies:
Isolation between security zones: 
	• We recommend you to design security zones to minimize the number of application data flows across the trust boundaries between zones. 
	
	• Perform a threat modelling exercise for every system and application data flow that crosses the trust boundary between zones, particularly focusing on:

Containment within security zones: 
We recommend you focus on protecting administrative control of assets in the security zone and ensure that least privilege is applied to access of business-sensitive assets.
