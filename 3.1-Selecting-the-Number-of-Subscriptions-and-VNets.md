# Selecting the Number of Subscriptions and VNets


Use the following guidance on determining the number of subscriptions and VNets you will require for your Azure network environment.


## Guidance
Consider the following when determining the number of subscriptions or VNets required:

  • If you require VMs to be placed in different Azure locations you will require VNets in multiple regions as the VNets in Azure are regional in nature. We recommend you create at least one VNet for each Azure location/region you want to host the VMs in.
	
  • If you require workloads or specific cloud services to be completely isolated from each another, create separate VNets that use separate IP address space. 

  • Networking limits are based on per-region and per-subscription. You can use multiple subscriptions to increase the number of resources maintained in Azure. Use a site-to-site VPN, or an ExpressRoute circuit, to connect VNets in different subscriptions.



## Procedure:  How to select your design pattern for subscriptions and VNets

Use the subscription pattern that best fits your business requirements, see: [Subscription Design Patterns](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-vnet-plan-design-arm#subscription-and-vnet-design-patterns).
