# Selecting an Azure Network DMZ Pattern

Use the information in this section to determine if you want to use a DMZ pattern. 

Use DMZs as a strategy to secure and protect publicly available IT systems. As soon as your server has a public face, it can be remotely rooted. If that happens, and a malicious party gains access to your server, he/she should be isolated in the DMZ network.

By placing your public facing servers in the "DMZ network," you are separating them from your private, trusted network. If you plan to expose services to the internet in Azure then you need to think about perimeter security. 


## Guidance
Set up a DMZ configuration using two firewalls:
 
  1. Set up a main firewall between the internet and  server.  
	
  2. Set up the second firewall between the server and the private network. All access from the server to the private network should be forbidden. 


## Next steps

  - [Deploying a DMZ between Azure and Internet](3.4.2-Deploying-a-DMZ-between-Azure-and-Internet.md):  Use the procedure described in this section to deploy a secure hybrid network that extends  between Azure and the Internet.
