# Using the Hub-and-Spoke VNet Pattern


Use the procedure described in this section to deploy the Hub-and-Spoke VNet pattern.

Use a Hub and Spoke VNet configuration to connect multiple VNets to a set of centralized virtual networks. The centralized virtual networks are themselves connected to each other.

**When to use**
Typical uses for this architecture include:

  - Workloads deployed in different environments, such as development, testing, and production, that require shared services such as DNS, IDS, NTP, or AD DS. Shared services are placed in the hub VNet, while each environment is deployed to a spoke to maintain isolation.
	
  - Workloads that do not require connectivity to each other, but require access to shared services.
	
  - Enterprises that require central control over security aspects, such as a firewall in the hub as a DMZ, and segregated management for the workloads in each spoke.


The figure below illustrates a Hub and Spoke configuration. The architecture provides for  centralized services that can be shared by multiple workloads in a single location.

|**Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |  
| -------------| -------------| 
| Cost savings by centralizing services that can be shared by multiple workloads, such as network virtual appliances (NVAs) and DNS servers, in a single location. | Requires fee payment for the VPN connection that you purchase from your network service provider. For optimal usage, the connectionâ€™s bandwidth has to match that from ExpressRoute.|
| Overcome subscriptions limits by peering VNets from different subscriptions to the central hub.| |
| Separation of duties between central IT (SecOps, InfraOps) and workloads (DevOps).| |
| Easy to add and remove spokes without affecting the rest of the network, giving business units great flexibility within their environments | |


## Guidance
Use the following supplemental information:

  - Consider the following [recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/hub-spoke#recommendations) when creating the hub-spoke VNet pattern
	
  - When considering the hub-spoke VNet with shared services pattern, consider reviewing the recommendations for [Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/shared-services#identity) and [Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/shared-services#security) in addition to the above recommendations.
	
  - Make sure you consider the limitation on number of VNets peerings per VNet in Azure. If you decide you need more spokes than the limit will allow, consider creating a hub-spoke-hub-spoke topology, where the first level of spokes also act as hubs.
	
  - Whether you consider a hub-spoke pattern or a hub-spoke with shared services pattern, think about what services are a shared in the hub so that you can ensure that you scale it for a larger number of spokes. This is important when defining the topology from a scalability perspective
		
  - Whether you implement a hub-spoke pattern or a hub-spoke with shared services pattern, ensure you implement governance such as just-in-time privilege management, real time alert monitoring to alert changes to resource groups, resource logging.
		
  - Verify that the IP address ranges for the VNets do not overlap with each other, or overlap with any of the ranges for other connections that the gateways may be connected to.
		
  - When working with gateway subnets, avoid associating a network security group (NSG) to the gateway subnet. Associating a network security group to this subnet may cause your VPN gateway to stop functioning as expected.
