# Monitoring Network Infrastructure Operations
Use the procedures described in this section to configure  Azure Log Analytics to capture and alert  operational activities occurring across your network resources within your subscriptions.
<br />
<br />

Azure activity log analytics is a feature under the Operation Management Suite (OMS) that gives you the ability to obtain detailed insights into the activities happening in your Azure environment. You can obtain activity information across multiple subscriptions.

With Azure Activity Log analytics you can:

- see operational activities aggregated by status
	
- view trends of activities happening on each of your Azure services
	
- report on authorization changes on all your Azure resources
	
- identify outages or service health issues impacting your resources
	
- create alert notifications to specific to Azure resources (i.e. Virtual Networks)
	
With Log search, you can correlate user activities, auto-scale your operations, authorization changes and service health to other logs or metrics for your environment.

## Guidance 
Use the following supplemental information:

- [Enable Diagnostic Logging to Stream logs to Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitor-stream-diagnostic-logs-log-analytics) for detailed analysis
	
- Understand [Log Searches in Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-log-search)

- [Enable Diagnostic Logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-of-diagnostic-logs#how-to-enable-collection-of-resource-diagnostic-logs) for all Azure network resources as well as resource groups that host the network resources.
	
- Ensure you are a subscription owner so that you can configure the network resources.
	
- [Create an OMS Workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-quick-create-workspace) and [Add the Azure Log Analytics Solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-add-solutions).
