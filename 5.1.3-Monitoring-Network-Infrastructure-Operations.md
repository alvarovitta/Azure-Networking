# Monitoring Network Infrastructure Operations


Use the procedures described in this section to configure  Azure Log Analytics to capture and alert  operational activities occurring across your network resources within your subscriptions.


Azure activity log analytics is a feature under the Operation Management Suite (OMS) that gives you the ability to obtain detailed insights into the activities happening in your Azure environment. You can obtain activity information across multiple subscriptions.

With Azure Activity Log analytics you can:

	• see operational activities aggregated by status

	• report on authorization changes on all your Azure resources
	
	• identify outages or service health issues impacting your resources
	
	• create alert notifications to specific to Azure resources (i.e. Virtual Networks)
	
With Log search, you can correlate user activities, auto-scale your operations, authorization changes and service health to other logs or metrics for your environment.
