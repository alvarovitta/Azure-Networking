# Selecting a Native Azure VNet Pattern
Use the information in this section to help determine your networking needs and plan the design for your virtual network (VNet). 
<br />
<br />


## Guidance
Use the following information when planning and designing your Azure VNet.

**Preparation considerations**:
- Review VNet considerations before you define the requirements.

- Consider the network virtual appliances you wish to deploy in Azure, see:  Azure Marketplace. 
- Understand the current Azure Limits to ensure your design does not conflict with any other limits
- Implement Azure RBAC roles to control the level of access users may have to the different virtual network resources in Azure

**Planning your Azure network design**:
- Identify the Azure Locations/Regions that will host your virtual networks.  e.g. Canada Central or Canada East 

- Determine the Type of virtual private connection used to connect your on-premises infrastructure to Azure. See: Site to Site, Point-to-Site or Express Route  
- Identify the Resource groups you will need to group the network resources together. A resource group can contain resources from multiple regions as long as the resources belong to the same subscription. See Resource Group. 
- Determine the Number of virtual networks you will need <1...n> 
- Choose to use the Azure-provided DNS server, or use your own DNS server. All resources that are connected to the virtual network are assigned this DNS server to resolve names within the virtual network.
- Determine How many Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) VMs, cloud services roles, and web apps you need for your solution
- Determine if you require Cross-premises networking and if you will require virtual network peering between your virtual networks. See Virtual Network Peering. 
- Determine How you wish to filter and isolate traffic between the virtual networks and its respective tiers (I.e. Web, Application, Data). See Network Security Groups. 
- Determine The subnets and address spaces you will be defining for each of the virtual networks. You can break into tiers (I.e. Web Tier, Application Tier, Database Tier, Internet Gateway Tier) <10.0.0.0...n>. 
- Identify the Service provider or exchange service provider you will partner with to connect to the cloud.  See: Connectivity Provider. 

**Designing your VNet**:
Use the information as shown in the following links when designing your VNet:
- [Selecting the Number of Subscriptions and VNets](3.1-Selecting-the-Number-of-Subscriptions-and-VNets.md)

- [Selecting the Number of Subnets and Network Security Groups (NSG)](3.2-Selecting-the-Number-of-Subnets-and-Network-Security-Groups.md)
<br />
<br />

## Next steps
Based on your VNet design, select a pattern which best fits your requirements:
-  [Using the VNet-to-VNet Network Pattern](3.3.1-Using-the-VNet-to-VNet-Network-Pattern.md): Use this pattern to connect virtual networks to each other.
	 
- [Using the Hub and Spoke VNet Pattern](3.3.2-Using-the-Hub-and-Spoke-VNet-Pattern.md): Use this pattern to connect multiple VNets to a set of centralized virtual networks.
- [Using the Mesh Network VNet Pattern](3.3.3-Using-the-Mesh-Network-VNet-Pattern.md): Use this pattern when you wish to isolate network connectivity to a set a virtual networks.
