# Securing your Virtual Network Traffic


Use the information in this section to implement security policies for your virtual network. 

Azure provides the following Network Data flow security controls that you can leverage as you design your VNet Data flow patterns:  


  - [Network Security Groups (NSGs)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-vnet-plan-design-arm):  Use NSGs to create rules (ACLs) at the desired level of granularity: network interfaces, individual VMs, or virtual subnets. 

  - [Service Tags for NSGs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/security-overview#service-tags):   Use service tags (AzureLoadBalancer, VirtualNetwork, Storage, SQL, Internet) to simplify security for your Azure VNs and VMs by limiting network access to the Azure services that you use. 

  - [Application security groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/security-overview#application-security-groups):  Use application security groups to configure network security as natural extension of an application’s structure, by arbitrarily grouping VMs and defining network security policies based on those groups. You can reuse your security policy and scale without manual maintenance of explicit IP addresses. 
	
  - [Augmented Security rules for NSGs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/security-overview#augmented-security-rules):  Use augmented rules for NSGs to simplify the security definition for Virtual Networks, so you can define larger, more complex network security policies with fewer rules. 
	
  - [Forced Tunneling](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-forced-tunneling-rm#about-forced-tunneling):  Use forced tunneling to redirect or "force" all Internet-bound traffic back to your on-premises location via a Site-to-Site VPN tunnel for inspection and auditing.  



## Guidance 

Use the following information when securing the traffic between the resources within your virtual network.

### For Network Security Groups

  - We recommend NSGs for each subnet to provide a second level of protection against inbound traffic bypassing an incorrectly configured or disabled NVA. 
	
  - Apply NSGs at the VM or NIC of a Virtual Machine. This allows greater flexibility in how traffic is filtered.
	
  - Leverage Virtual Appliances for anywhere you need detailed data plane information or security stacks
	
  - Leverage UDR to control traffic flow and targeted default routes
	
  - The VPN gateway exposes a public IP address for the connection to the on-premises network. We recommend creating a network security group (NSG) for the inbound NVA subnet, with rules to block all traffic not originating from the on-premises network.
	
  - Endpoint-based ACLs and network security groups are not supported on the same VM instance. If you want to use an NSG and have an endpoint ACL already in place, first remove the endpoint ACL. To learn how to remove an ACL, read the [Managing Access Control Lists (ACLs) for Endpoints by using PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-acl-powershell) article.
	
  - Consider the number of tiers your workload requires. Each tier can be isolated by using a subnet, with an NSG applied to the subnet.
	
  - If you need to implement a subnet for a VPN gateway, or ExpressRoute circuit, do not apply an NSG to that subnet. If you do so, cross-VNet or cross-premises connectivity may fail.
	
  - If you need to implement a network virtual appliance (NVA), connect the NVA to its own subnet and create user-defined routes (UDR) to and from the NVA. You can implement a subnet level NSG to filter traffic in and out of this subnet. To learn more about UDRs, read the [User-defined routes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview) article.
	
  - Decide on your NSG priority order as Ingress traffic to the VM, rules are applied at a subnet level, then VM level, and then NIC level. While for egress traffic from the VM, rules are applied at the NIC level, then VM level, and then subnet level
	 
	
### For forced tunneling
	
- We recommend combining forced tunneling with network security groups to achieve defense in depth of traffic isolation.
	
- Investigate the use of an dual-NIC edge firewall appliance with an extranet subnet as one alternative to NSGs.
	
- Ensure that any user defined routes (UDR) are more specific than ExpressRoute BGP routes or Local Site Network routes, otherwise the UDR will not be used


### Other

- [Azure Application Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-network-security#application-gateway):  Use the Application Gateway to optimize web farm performance and availability. 
	
- [Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-network-security#azure-web-application-firewall-waf): Web applications are targeted by attacks that exploit known vulnerabilities. Preventing such exploits requires maintenance, patching, and monitoring at multiple layers of the application topology. Use WAF to react to a security threat faster by patching a known vulnerability at a central location versus securing each of individual web applications.



## Preparation

Use the following in preparation to securing your virtual network.

### For Network Security Groups
	
  - Identify your network requirements:
	- What types of resources do you want to filter traffic to or from? You can connect resources such as NICs (Resource Manager), VMs (classic), Cloud Services, Application Service Environments, and VM Scale Sets.
	- Are the resources you want to filter traffic to/from connected to subnets in existing VNets?
		
  - Decide what to target with NSGs based on NSG’s limits:
	- Choose to target by VM when the number  of systems which require this ruleset (both immediately and in the future) is unknown
	- Choose to target by subnet when the rulesets are defined by role and the number of systems which the NSG will be expected to apply is well known and appropriate subnet sizes can be determined for these systems
		
  - Decide on the precedence of NSGs before deploying onto existing NSGs at the subnet and VM levels. Consider the following:
	- Denial at Subnet takes precedence over allow at VM or NIC level
	- Denial at VM level takes precedence over allow at the NIC level or the subnet level
        - Denial at NIC level takes precedence over allow at VM or subnet level

### For Forced Tunneling

Determine how forced tunneling will be used in a design based on the following decisions:

  - Determine the type of network connectivity to implement (i.e. Site-to-Site or ExpressRoute). This will help you define the scope of impact
  - Identify the requirements for direct Internet egress via Azure’s Internet connection 
  - Identify your security requirements and flexibility
