# Deploying a DMZ between Azure and On-Premises
Use the procedure described in this section to deploy a secure hybrid network that extends an on-premises network to Azure.
<br />
<br />

**When to use**
- Hybrid applications where workloads run partly on-premises and partly in Azure.

- Infrastructure that requires granular control over traffic entering an Azure VNet from an on-premises datacenter.
- Applications that must audit outgoing traffic. This is often a regulatory requirement of many commercial systems and can help to prevent public disclosure of private information.
<br />
<br />

As shown in the figure below, the architecture implements a DMZ, also called a perimeter network, between the on-premises network and an Azure virtual network (VNet). 

The DMZ includes network virtual appliances (NVAs) that implement security functionality such as firewalls and packet inspection. All outgoing traffic from the VNet is force-tunneled to the Internet through the on-premises network, so that it can be audited.
This architecture requires a connection to on-premises datacenter, using either a [VPN gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/vpn) or an [ExpressRoute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/expressroute) connection.

|**Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |  
| -------------| -------------| 
| Applicable where workloads run partly on-premises and partly in Azure | Adds a layer of complexity in terms of configuration and management as it requires multiple Azure resources such as NVA, load balancer, etc. |
| Provides granular control over traffic entering an Azure VNET from an on-premises network ||
| Helps to comply with regulatory requirements of many commercial systems and can help prevent public disclosure of private information ||
|Provides dynamic routing between your network and Microsoft over industry standard protocols (BGP). ||

## Guidance
Use the following supplemental information:
- Use [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal?toc=%252fazure%252factive-directory%252ftoc.json) to manage the resources in your application. Consider creating the following custom roles

- Follow the [Resource Group recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/dmz/secure-vnet-hybrid#resource-group-recommendations).
- On-premises traffic passes to the VNet through a virtual network gateway. We recommend an [Azure VPN gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/vpn) or an [Azure ExpressRoute gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/expressroute).
- Follow these [Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/dmz/secure-vnet-hybrid#nva-recommendations).
- Follow the [Network Security Group (NSG) recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/dmz/secure-vnet-hybrid#nsg-recommendations).
- Follow the [Internet access recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/dmz/secure-vnet-hybrid#internet-access-recommendations).
- Follow the [Management Subnet recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/dmz/secure-vnet-hybrid#management-subnet-recommendations) for the jump box.
<br />
<br />

## Preparation
- Ensure you have the correct permissions to Azure before starting the implementation (I.e. Subscription Owner)

- Review the prerequisites for [ExpressRoute and VPN prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-prerequisites). 
- Review the link to help you [Validate the Types of VPN devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices#devicetable) that are compatible with Azure  
- Before configuring your VPN device, check for any [Known device compatibility issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices#known) for the VPN device that you want to use.  
- Determine which VPN type you want to implement, see: [Path-Based or Route-Based](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-plan-design#vpntype).   
- Determine the type of [Gateway SKU](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-plan-design#gwsku) you wish to implement.  
- Consider configuring [forced tunnel routing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-forced-tunneling-rm#configure-forced-tunneling) if your security requirements require you to inspect and audit all internet traffic to and from your Azure network.  
- Follow the guide on [How to Create a High Available Cross-Premise Connection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-highlyavailable).
