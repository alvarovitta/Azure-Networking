# Evaluating your Business Requirements for Azure Networking
Use the information in this section to analyze and evaluate your organization's business requirements. 
<br />
<br />

Your business requirements drive the underlying architecture of your Azure network. Engage with your lines of business (LOBs) to understand their current and future key business needs. 
<br />
<br />

## Guidance
Use the analysis results from the list below in tandem with the feedback from your LOBs to design and build your Azure network infrastructure.  
<br />
**1. Evaluate business requirements to:**
	  
- Expand your organization's on-premises data center to Azure data centers		 
- Integrate on-premises data center IT operations with Azure networking
- Enable secure communications between the on-premises network and Azure networking
- Adhere to compliance and security regulations (GDPR, PCI, HiPPA, SOX, GLBA, etc.)
- Migrate legacy applications to Azure in a timely fashion
<br />

**2.  Evaluate network integration requirements:** 
- Work with your network team to evaluate and identify your desired Azure networking requirements.
- Identify the Azure region to which you wish to deploy your Azure networks.
- Evaluate and identify the networking tools, components and appliances (hardware and virtual) that you will need. Identify the elements that you have to optimize to move to Azure. 
- Evaluate network integration components and requirements for network identity management and network security. 
- Ensure you have a reliable and functional backup connectivity strategy. If you lose your connection to your cloud provider, you've lost your ability to communicate.
<br />

**3. Evaluate the applications that run in your on-premises environment:** 
- Work with your IT Operations and IT department to evaluate the user requirements to migrate applications to Azure. Use this evaluation to identify the networking requirements to implement a solution for seamless, end-user access. 
- Identify the types of applications you wish to migrate to Azure. 
- Identify the administrators that require secure access to Azure workloads (for administration purposes).
- Based on the evaluation of your LOB application requirements, identify the type of service you wish to implement. Review the services listed below: <br />
